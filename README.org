* Loxtester

Test Lox implementations against the Lox test suite.

** Requirements
- A modern JVM
- A recent-ish version of sbt

** Usage
There is a Makefile with some helper commands. Of course, keeping sbt alive
between runs is faster, but the Makefile is convenient.

** Features
- Run the entire Lox suite against a Lox implementation

** Why this instead of the main repo
The original test suite is implemented in Dart 2. Dart 2 seems to not be
compatible with Dart 3, making it a hassle to install in modern development
environments. There are options such as virtualization, or deterministic builds,
but the quickest option for me was to reimplement the suite in a language I
could run. Thus, Scala and sbt.

Some features of the original test suite are missing. This suite can't run "all
tests up to a certain chapter of the book". It could be done, but it's a lot of
grunt work.
